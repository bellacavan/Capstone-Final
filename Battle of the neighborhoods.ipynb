            "source": "Paris is the capital city of France. There are currently 20 arrondissments (or districts) in Paris. In each District of Paris, there is a town hall (Mairie) and a mayor (Maire), as well as elected officials, a council, a politician, and so on. The Arrondissements of Paris are not to be confused with the Parisian Quartiers (Paris Neighborhoods). Parisian Quartiers, like Belleville, Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e8s, and many more, are historic neighborhoods while the Arrondissements of Paris exist only since the 18 century. One Arrondissement usually includes many Paris Neighborhoods within its boundaries. The 1st Arrondissement of Paris is in the center of the city, then the other Paris Arrondissements are located forming a spiral turning clockwise, to finish in the 20th Arrondissement in the east. [Accornig to statistics](https://www.condorferries.co.uk/france-tourism-statistics) over 40 million people visit Paris each year. I want to know whichof the 20 arondissments is the safest."
